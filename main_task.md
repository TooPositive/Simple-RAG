langgraph is used in the following file:

File: /Users/bb/Programming/Simple-RAGv1/Simple-RAG/src/agent/orchestrator.py
Line 8: from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
It is utilized in the function create_agent_graph() (defined at line 19) to create a state graph that likely manages the flow and state of the agent within the system.
Relevant Code Excerpt:
# In orchestrator.py
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END  # Line 8

def create_agent_graph() -> StateGraph:  # Line 19
langgraph is integral for structuring and managing the state transitions within the agent's operational framework, allowing for complex decision-making processes.

======================================================================
We chose Langgraph over Langchain primarily because Langgraph offers better integration with graph systems and enhances the reliability of our solutions when combined with language models (LM). Langgraph allows us to effectively manage connections and relationships within data, which is crucial for handling complex queries, especially in scenarios requiring multi-hop reasoning. 

Additionally, the ease of installation and usability of Langgraph, particularly with graph databases like Neo4j, made it a more practical choice for our needs. Overall, Langgraph's capabilities in handling graph representations and connections align better with our project objectives compared to Langchain.

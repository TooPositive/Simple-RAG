You've built and tested the entire application. The final task is to package everything for submission, ensuring anyone can understand, install, and run your project. This is a crucial step for professional software development.

### **Spec Task `DELIVER-1`: Finalization and Documentation**

#### **🎯 Objective**

To prepare the project for submission by creating a complete `requirements.txt` file, writing clear documentation, and generating a log of the chatbot's performance on the required test questions.

#### **🔑 Key Components & Rationale**

  * **`requirements.txt`:** A finalized list of dependencies is essential for reproducibility. Anyone cloning your repository should be able to create an identical environment with a single command. The `pip freeze` command is the standard way to generate this file accurately.
  * **`README.md`:** This is the front door to your project. A good README clearly explains what the project is, what its requirements are, and how to run it. This saves others time and makes your work look professional.
  * **`qa_log.txt`:** This file provides direct evidence that your chatbot works as intended. It's a deliverable that proves you've met the assignment's specific testing requirements.

#### **✅ Acceptance Criteria**

1.  The `requirements.txt` file is updated to include all necessary libraries with their exact versions.
2.  A `README.md` file is created in the root directory.
3.  The `README.md` contains sections for:
      * Project goal.
      * Setup instructions (creating `.env`, installing dependencies).
      * How to run the application (`python main.py`).
4.  A `qa_log.txt` file is created.
5.  This log file contains the three specified questions from the assignment and the exact answers generated by your chatbot.

#### **📝 Detailed Steps**

1.  **Finalize `requirements.txt`:**

      * With your virtual environment active, run the following command in the root directory of your project. This will overwrite your existing `requirements.txt` with a complete list of all libraries and their specific versions.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```bash
    pip freeze > requirements.txt
    ```

2.  **Create `README.md`:**

      * In the root directory, create a file named `README.md` and add the following content as a template. Be sure to fill it out.

    <!-- end list -->

    # RAG Chatbot for "Databases for GenAI" Lecture

    This project is a functional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot built from scratch in Python. It can ingest a knowledge base from both PDF and audio files and answer questions based on their content.

    ## Features

    -   Loads and extracts text from PDF documents.
    -   Transcribes audio files using Azure OpenAI's Whisper model.
    -   Chunks text into semantically meaningful pieces.
    -   Generates vector embeddings using Azure OpenAI.
    -   Stores and indexes embeddings in a persistent ChromaDB vector database.
    -   Provides an interactive command-line interface for asking questions.

    ## Project Setup

    1.  **Clone the repository:**
        ```bash
        git clone <your-repo-url>
        cd rag-chatbot
        ```

    2.  **Create a virtual environment:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv .venv
        source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .\.venv\Scripts\activate
        ```

    3.  **Install dependencies:**
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```

    4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
        Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
        Now, edit the `.env` file and add your actual Azure OpenAI credentials.

    ## How to Run

    1.  **Add Data:** Place your knowledge base files (PDFs, `.wav`, `.mp3`) into the `./data` directory.

    2.  **Run the Chatbot:**
        Execute the main script from the root directory:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        The first time you run the application, it will process the files in the `data` directory and build the vector database. This may take some time. Subsequent runs will be much faster as they will load the existing database.

    ## Testing

    The project includes a full suite of unit and integration tests. You can run them using `pytest`:
    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    ````

3.  **Generate `qa_log.txt`:**

      * Run your chatbot (`python main.py`).
      * Ask each of the three questions from the assignment, one by one.
      * Create a new file named `qa_log.txt` in the root directory.
      * Copy and paste the questions and the chatbot's exact answers into this file. Format it clearly, like this:

    <!-- end list -->
